   <p>Completing my high school courses early in my senior year allowed me to start my apprenticeship early. Through a work program I worked full time every other week.The following week I was back in school with little to do. When the welding instructor asked if I wanted to learn to weld, I jumped at the opportunity.  I could have just as easily spent my life as a metal fabricator. To be a proficient welder you need to do it often, so I can't call myself a welder and several times I have taken courses to stay somewhat capable.</p>

    <p>Every Saturday for three quarters of a year I apprenticed with a fifth generation Blacksmith. His shop had no electricity and anything with a long handle or a crank was the responsibility of the apprentice. The iron roses in the photo above were made in my own shop and were a combination of forging and gas welding.</p>

    <p>“Zero Dollar Dougie Strikes Again” Made entirely from scraps and left over hardware the blue metal break was made with a little forging and MIG welding. The top portion is easily removed providing more work space. The tool box for my bottle jack was also made from scrap material and hardware that was saved from the job site dumpster.</p>

    <p>Much of my electrical work requires metal working. It's very satisfying taking raw materials and building and shaping them into functional systems. Here the feeder conduits, large pull box and supports all require metal work. I also think there is an artistic value as well.</p>
