            <h3>Experience:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>Electrician/Systems Tech:</h4>
                    <p>I started my electrical career by attending a full time Vo-Tech High School, then as an apprentice in 1979. While working on industrial and commercial projects I worked my way up to Journeyman then to Master Electrician. As electronic controls became more prevalent,  I went back to school and earned an Associates degree in Electronic Engineering Technology. I applied this knowledge by working several years as a System Tech, but have since returned to industrial and commercial electricity. </p></li>
