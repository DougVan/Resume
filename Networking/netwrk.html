   <h3>Computer Netwoking</h3>
   <p>As the electrical industry progressed from discrete devices with interconnecting wires to produce the system logic to programmable controls, so did the need to advance my computer and networking skills.</p>
    <p>As a systems technician programming takes on many forms and the introduction of networking enhanced the capability of those systems. Access control, security systems and camera systems became their own networks and allowed for remote connectivity and configuration. Ethernet relays allowed for remote control of discrete devices.</p>
    <p>My electronic studies at NHTI, on the job training and home hobbies help build my computer and programming skills and later I returned to NHTI for two semesters of computer networking. After completing my studies I became Cisco CCENT certified.</p>
